# mazeproject

To run with Maven in VSCode:

1. Make sure you have Java JDK 22 Downloaded

2. Install Apache Maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html (Any other way works -- I did it on MacOS with Homebrew)

3. Install VSCode "Maven for Java" Extension

4. In the `Explorer` sidebar on VSCode, open the `Maven` section at the bottom.

5. Open `mazeproject`, then open `Plugins`

6. To run the JavaFX gui, open the `javafx` plugin and click the arrow on `run`.

7. To run the `Main` file (no gui, just for testing), open the `exec` plugin and click the arrow on `java`.
