# mazeproject

`MazeProject` is a set of maze solving and generating algorithms in Java. It comes with a fully-featured GUI for maze visualization. MazeProject was developed as part of a project in CSC 345 at the University of Arizona.

In this project we implement various maze generation and solving algorithms, we  explored complex theoretical concepts in a practical setting, using manipulated data structures like priority queues, union-finds, and graph traversal methods such as BFS, DFS, and A-Star. Developed a GUI client for visualizing algorithms showcasing interface design and system integration.

### Maze Generation

The following maze generation algorithms are implemented:

- Backtracking
- Kruskal's
- Prim's
- Wilson's

### Maze Solving

The following maze solving algorithms are implemented:

- Dijkstra's
- **A-Star** (project focus)
- Breadth-First-Search (BFS)
- Tremaux

## Project structure

All source code is located in `src/main/java/com/csc345`. That folder has two classes: `App.java`, the entrypoint for the JavaFX gui (main intended entry point), and `Main.java`, the entrypoint for testing console output. From there, the directory structure is as follows:

```
.
├── core/: all maze-related implementation code
│   ├── maze_algorithms/: all maze-generating algorithms
│   ├── solve_algorithms/ all maze-solving algorithms
│   ├── Maze.java: helper methods for generating mazes
│   ├── Node.java: mazes consist of a 1D array of Nodes
│   └── State.java: enum for algorithm process
├── data/: all custom generic data structures and more
│   ├── functionals/: all custom functional interfaces
│   └── types/: all custom data types
└── gui/
    ├── animations/: classes for animating maze algorithms

    ├── MazeController.java: toolbar panel for maze controls
    └── MazeImage.java image for displaying maze

## Running `MazeProject`

To run with Maven in VSCode:

1. Make sure you have Java JDK 22 Downloaded.

2. Install Apache Maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html (Any other way works, such as in MacOS with Homebrew)

3. Clone the project into a directory on your computer.

4. Navigate to the project in the terminal with `cd path/to/project`.

5. Run `mvn clean install`

5. To run the `JavaFX` gui, run `mvn clean javafx:run`.

6. To run the `Main` class, run `mvn clean exec:java`
